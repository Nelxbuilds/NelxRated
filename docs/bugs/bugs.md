## BUG-4 — Account name is not updated in export
**Story**: 3-4
**Status**: open
**Found**: Change account name and do new export
**Description**: While I do understand that most likely account name would be updated with a new game being recorded. If there is no account name set for records and in settings a new account name is being added. Wouldn't it make sense to add this account name to those empty entries. Do not overwrite existing account names.
**Fix**: (fill in when resolved)

## BUG-3 — Active tab overlaps nearly with other tabs
**Story**: 3-1
**Status**: open
**Found**: Open with /nxr and just click on a tab
**Description**: I have given you a demo with bug-3.png
**Fix**: (fill in when resolved)

## BUG-2 — Cannot close export after clicking on export once
**Story**: 3-4
**Status**: fixed
**Found**: Just clicking Export in the Import/Export.
**Description**: It grows that text field so much, that you can't seen anything anymore. and even closing the windows didn't restore the previous state. Only /reload helped
**Fix**: Wrapped both export and import EditBoxes in ScrollFrames (UIPanelScrollFrameTemplate) so they stay at fixed 120px height instead of auto-growing with content.

## BUG-1 — /nxr doesn't open on first enter
**Story**: 2-2
**Status**: fixed
**Found**: human checkpoint for this story
**Description**: first command execution of /nxr does nothing. No LUA error just nothing. On second execution the challenges frame is being shown
**Fix**: Frame was shown by default on creation, then the toggle immediately hid it. Added early return after first creation so the frame stays visible.
